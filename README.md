 ## Description
This application aims to make it easy to jot down quick notes and keep them all in one location. With this web application, you can add a title and some text to a note and click "Save Note" and the note will appear in a list of all previously saved notes on the lefthand side of the webpage. When you want to delete a note, you can click the trashcan button on the righthand side of that specific note and the note will be trashed.

## Installation
You install this project a few different ways. You could deploy it from VS code to a local port, or you could use a program such as Insomnia or Heroku to deploy the page.

## Usage
The application is used by opening it to whichever means you choose (the local port or an application such as Heroku or Insomia). From there you will arrive at a landing page that prompts you to "Get Started" with Note Taker. When you click that button, you are redirected to a page that allows you to create new notes and shows previously saved notes on the lefthand side.
